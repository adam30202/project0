# Project Zero - Tic Tac Toe

## Technologies Used:

-   HTML
-   CSS
-   JavaScript
-   jQuery
-   Animations obtained from the following websites:
    -   https://animate.style/
    -   https://getcssscan.com/css-buttons-examples
-   Imported Google font:
    -   https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Press+Start+2P&display=swap

## Chat it can do:

-   Tic tac toe can be played.

-   X's or O's are added to the board using a jQuery event listener. It listens for a 'click' anywhere on the 3x3 board - then, determines which box specifically was clicked. A class is then added to said box which adds an X or O to the box's background.

-   The program can determine the result of a game. The result is dynamically added above the game board after every game (X win, O win, or a draw).

-   A 'Play again?' button is dynamically added above the game board after every game. After the button is clicked, the board is reset and the result is removed from the screen.

-   The user can also choose whether an X or O will be placed first.

-   The score is tracked in the top left corner.

## What can it not do:

-   Currently the user cannot play against the computer.
-   The game is restricted to only a 3x3 board.
-   Players cannot customize their X or O tokens.
